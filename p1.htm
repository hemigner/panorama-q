      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>I love to explore the intersection of technology and business. During my academic journey, I've eagerly pursued opportunities to gain hands-on experience in various industries. I've dabbled in three part-time jobs, gaining valuable insights into different professional environments and honing my skills in communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. Additionally, I've ventured into entrepreneurship, founding and managing three businesses of my own.</p>
